                Do you want your Twitter followers to hear about new {{ JOB_TYPE_DESCRIPTION }}, as soon as
                they're posted &mdash; so your friends get the first chance to apply?
            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
        Every time someone posts a job here (well, just as soon as we've checked it
        out by hand to make sure it's not inappropriate or spam) the
        <a href="http://www.twitter.com/{{ OWN_TWITTER_ACCOUNT_ID }}">{{ JOBS_BOARD_TITLE }} twitter account</a>
        tweets about it.  If you authorise
        our Twitter app, you'll automatically retweet it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Obviously we promise not to do anything else with your account, and you can
        revoke our tweeting privileges at any time, using
        <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications">this page on the Twitter site</a>.
        We don't get access to your Twitter password or anything like that.
